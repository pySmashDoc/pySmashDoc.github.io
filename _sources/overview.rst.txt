Overview
========
In the field of chemoinformatics, there is a saying that similar structures have similar properties. The main aim of chemoinformatics refers to analyzing the similarity among molecules, searching the molecules in the structural database, finding potential drug molecule and their property. To systematically obtain the relation between structure and property, we developed pySmash, a Python library designed for obtaining fragments, which are highly related to a specific endpoint conveniently and comprehensively. pySmash can smash molecules, which have certein property label, with three different algorithms, including **circular**-, **path**- and **function group**-based, and combined with statistical methods to a set of significant fragments. By using these fragments, the molecule with unknown label can got a predicted label. Besides, pySmash provides functionalities for the easy visualization of the derived fragments. The Python package pySmash is designed by `CBDD Group`_ (Computational Biology & Drug Design Group), Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University.

Who uses pySmash?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
pySmash is a comprehensive and uniform Python package which aims at providing an convenient and comprehensive method to obtain meaningful fragments instead of traditional manual induction. Researchers who want to build link between structure and property, and use this relationship for further research, can use pySmash as a credible and efficient tool. We believe that, by the rational application of pySmash, users can draw useful knowledge and experience across many disciplines, thus decreasing the time and cost for drug research.

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~
pySmash is intended to provide

-  Tools for smashing molecules

-  Calculation of meaningful fragments related with specific property

-  Prediction of unknown label molecules

-  Visualization of significant fragments


The Python programming language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible representations of biochemical molecules, and clear and concise expressions of bioinformatics algorithms. Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that pySmash uses to provide more features such as RDkit. In addition, Python is also an excellent “glue” language for putting together pieces of software from other languages which allows reuse of legacy code and engineering of high-performance algorithms. Equally important, Python is free, well-supported, and a joy to use. In order to make full use of pySmash, you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python.
