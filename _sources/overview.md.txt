# Overview

Structural alerts are widely applied in drug discovery and have been instrumental in evaluating potency against its intended target, appropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) properties and an acceptable safety profile. They are also integrated into the application of QSAR model, which can provide wide application domain and clear interpretability. With the increase of the available public domain resources, computational data-driven systems which can draw on large databases, analyze the underlying data, and apply the resulting knowledge automatically with no human intervention get more attention. Here, PySmash is presented, which offers several advantages for the automatic derivation and application of the derived structural alerts: (1) various alert derivation algorithms; (2) simple and convenient operation; (3) easy visualization of the derived structural alerts, (4) substructure anlysis for neither positive or negative set and (5) integration of the alerts extraction and application. It provides both Python package and software, which can meet the different research need. PySmash is designed by [CBDD Group](http://home.scbdd.com/index.php?s=/Home/Index.html&t=english) (Computational Biology & Drug Design Group), Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University.

pySmash provides 3 algorithms, including circular-, path-, and function group-based, to smash a molecule.

(1) **Circular Fragment**
Circular fragments is built by applying the Morgan algorithm. When generating circular fragments, Morgan fingerprints are calculated firstly under the given radius, and then circular fragments would be retrieved through combining the information of each bit with specific function.

(2) **Path-based Fragment**
The path-based fragment algorithm identifies all subgraphs in the molecule within a particular range of sizes. Like generation of circular fragments, the RDKit fingerprints are calculated at first under minimum and maximum length. Through the bitinfo, the fragments are obtained.

(3) **Function Group Fragment**
This fragments are implemented by this [article](https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-017-0225-z), which proposed an algorithm to identify functional groups in organic molecules.

## Who uses pySmash?


PySmash is a comprehensive and uniform software which aims at providing an convenient and comprehensive method to obtain meaningful fragments instead of traditional manual induction. Researchers who want to detect representative substructures can use PySmash as a credible and efficient tool. We believe that, by the rational application of PySmash, users can draw useful knowledge and experience across many disciplines, thus decreasing the time and cost for drug research.

## Motivation

PySmash is intended to provide offer several advantages for the automatic derivation and application of the derived structural alerts: 

  (1) Various alert derivation algorithms; 

  (2) Simple and convenient operation; 

  (3) Visualization of the derived structural alerts; 

  (4) Substructure analysis for either positive or negative set; 

  (5) Integration of the alerts extraction and application.

## The Python programming language

Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible representations of biochemical molecules, and clear and concise expressions of bioinformatics algorithms. Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that pySmash uses to provide more features such as RDkit. In addition, Python is also an excellent “glue” language for putting together pieces of software from other languages which allows reuse of legacy code and engineering of high-performance algorithms. Equally important, Python is free, well-supported, and a joy to use. In order to make full use of pySmash, you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python.
