Welcome to PySmash's documentation!
===================================
Structural alerts are widely applied in drug discovery and have been instrumental in evaluating potency against its intended target, appropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) properties and an acceptable safety profile. They are also integrated into the application of QSAR model, which can provide wide application domain and clear interpretability. With the increase of the available public domain resources, computational data-driven systems which can draw on large databases, analyze the underlying data, and apply the resulting knowledge automatically with no human intervention get more attention. Here, PySmash is presented, which offers several advantages for the automatic derivation and application of the derived structural alerts: (1) various alert derivation algorithms; (2) simple and convenient operation; (3) easy visualization of the derived structural alerts, (4) substructure anlysis for neither positive or negative set and (5) integration of the alerts extraction and application. It provides both Python package and software, which can meet the different research need. PySmash is designed by `CBDD Group`_ (Computational Biology & Drug Design Group), Xiangya School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University.
